        <p class="profile">These are some of my projects from the last few years. I started with editing, then moved on to 3D animations, and more recently to programming. Among them are larger projects, such as the ATN animation and the Axolotl Game, which took several months to complete. You’ll also find a few smaller ones here that I really enjoyed creating—like this website, which also happens to be my very first web development project.</p>
